## Rules of cribbage
Cribbage is a card game in which two players compete to reach a score of 121 points before their opponent. During a round, each player is dealt 6 cards and chooses two to "throw" or remove from their hands. These thrown cards are combined to form the "crib" so that each player has four cards in their hand and there are four cards in the crib. After players choose which cards to throw, the deck is cut and a card from the deck is turned over. It is treated as a part of both players' hands and the crib for the purposes of scoring. Each hand is scored for several possible card combinations including pairs of cards with the same rank, runs of cards with adjacent ranks, and cards whose values sum to exactly 15. Players also score points during a pegging phase in every round, where the players play cards one at a time and score points based on combinations of their own and their opponenents cards that have been played.
