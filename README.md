Summary: Program to advise which cards to discard in cribbage to obtain highest-scoring hand

Description: Cribbage is a card game in which two players compete to reach a score of 121 points before their opponent. During a round, each player is dealt 6 cards and chooses two to "throw" or remove from their hands. These thrown cards are combined to form the "crib" so that each player has four cards in their hand and there are four cards in the crib. After players choose which cards to throw, the deck is cut and a card from the deck is turned over. 

Progess: Allowed user to optimize cribbage hand considering only the personal scoring of their hand and not the score of the cards the crib or the score from the pegging round. The next step is likely to be accounting for the cards in the crib. This will involve the determination of optimal strategies using game theory.
